# Junior Developer Technical Assessment

This GitHub repository contains my submission for Novatech's junior developer technical assessment.
The task took me approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete. A significant portion of this time was spent reacquainting myself with Java's syntax after a long break, and once I got back into the rhythm, it became relatively straightforward. The aspects that took the longest were working with IO streams to access the CSV file with OpenCSV, and utilizing Jackson for handling JSON objects, including their serialization and deserialization.
Overall, I really enjoyed the task and appreciated the opportunity to refresh my Java skills - something I have not done in quite some time.
